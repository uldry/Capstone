# Capstone
A fraction of the code developped as part of my capstone project at BrainStation.

EconomicalNews: Web scrapping the economical news and making a feature

Data: EUR/USD currency pair with other features such as News and major Stock index

The goal of the project was to try to predict the exchange rate for a currency pair.
A few features were used to try to get a better prediction, but the trend prediction was close to random and the residual error too high.
